# NostosResto-MyFirstClient
This is the e-menu and site for the restaurant NOSTOS
https://restaurantnostos.com/

This is my first ever client! 
I had the opportunity to work with a local restaurant(NOSTOS) here in Montreal!

I cold called the owner and pitched him the idea of having a site for his business, 
upon meeting with him, the idea turned into restaurant and e-menu. 

I made him QR codes for him to have on his table

Essentially it is based on a copyright free teamplate I found online. I made enormous adjustments but I needed the base.
I chose to do that to save time also because at the time I was not experienced enough to make sliding pictures on my own.
It took about 20h to tailor it the way the owner wanted it to be. 

The challenge of this app is that I had to add CSS @media to the site, since it is a e-menu, clients scan the code and get the site on 
their phones. 

I did the photography as well (except for a few exceptions) 

The site so far has increased the owner's online presence, it has reduced costs(he no longer has to make menus), I made him his own Github so he can 
change the prices whenever he wants. I made him a little instructions sheet as well. 

HTML and CSS are the main technologies with a little JS for the behavioral side.
